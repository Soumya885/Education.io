# ðŸ”¹ Class 10 Science Notes (NCERT)

## **Physics**

### 1. Electricity

* Electric current (I = Q/t), Potential difference (V), Resistance (R).
* Ohmâ€™s Law: $V = IR$.
* Factors affecting resistance: length, area, material, temperature.
* Resistors in series and parallel.
* Electric power: $P = VI = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$.
* Commercial unit: 1 kWh = 1 unit.

### 2. Magnetic Effects of Electric Current

* Magnetic field & field lines.
* Rightâ€“hand thumb rule.
* Force on current-carrying conductor: $F = BIL \sin\theta$.
* Electromagnet vs permanent magnet.
* Domestic electric circuits: fuse, earthing, MCB, three wires (live, neutral, earth).

### 3. Sources of Energy

* Conventional: fossil fuels, thermal power, hydropower.
* Non-conventional: solar, wind, biomass, tidal, nuclear.
* Renewable vs non-renewable.
* Qualities of good fuel: cheap, easily available, high calorific value, environmentâ€“friendly.

### 4. Human Eye and Colourful World

* Structure: cornea, lens, retina, iris, ciliary muscles.
* Defects: myopia (corrected by concave lens), hypermetropia (convex lens), presbyopia.
* Refraction: atmospheric refraction, twinkling of stars.
* Dispersion: rainbow formation.
* Scattering: Tyndall effect, colour of sky, reddish sunset.

## **Chemistry**

### 5. Chemical Reactions and Equations

* Types: Combination, Decomposition, Displacement, Double displacement, Oxidationâ€“reduction.
* Corrosion (rusting), rancidity.
* Balanced equations with physical states.

### 6. Acids, Bases and Salts

* Indicators: litmus, phenolphthalein, methyl orange.
* Reactions:

  * Acid + Base â†’ Salt + Water (Neutralisation)
  * Acid + Metal â†’ Salt + Hâ‚‚
  * Base + Metal â†’ Salt + Hâ‚‚
* Important salts: NaCl, Baking soda (NaHCOâ‚ƒ), Washing soda (Naâ‚‚COâ‚ƒ.10Hâ‚‚O), Plaster of Paris (CaSOâ‚„Â·Â½Hâ‚‚O).
* pH scale (0â€“14).

### 7. Metals and Non-Metals

* Physical & chemical properties.
* Metals form positive ions, non-metals negative ions.
* Reactions with oxygen, water, acids.
* Reactivity series, displacement reactions.
* Ionic bonding.
* Extraction of metals (ore â†’ concentration â†’ reduction â†’ refining).
* Corrosion and prevention.

### 8. Carbon and Its Compounds

* Covalent bonding, versatile nature of carbon.
* Hydrocarbons: alkanes, alkenes, alkynes.
* Functional groups: alcohol (â€“OH), aldehyde (â€“CHO), ketone (â€“COâ€“), carboxylic acid (â€“COOH).
* Homologous series.
* Important reactions: combustion, oxidation, addition, substitution, esterification, saponification.
* Soap vs detergent.

### 9. Periodic Classification of Elements

* Dobereinerâ€™s triads, Newlandsâ€™ octaves, Mendeleevâ€™s table.
* Modern periodic table: arranged by atomic number.
* Periods and groups.
* Trends:

  * Atomic size â†“ across period, â†‘ down group.
  * Metallic character â†“ across period, â†‘ down group.
  * Valency across a period 1â†’4â†’0.

## **Biology**

### 10. Life Processes

* Nutrition: autotrophic (photosynthesis equation), heterotrophic (holozoic).
* Respiration: aerobic vs anaerobic.
* Transportation: human circulatory system (heart, arteries, veins, capillaries).
* Lymph, platelets, WBC, RBC.
* Excretion: kidneys, nephron, dialysis.

### 11. Control and Coordination

* Nervous system: neuron, synapse, reflex action.
* Human brain: cerebrum, cerebellum, medulla.
* Plant hormones: auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid.
* Tropic movements: phototropism, geotropism, hydrotropism.

### 12. How Do Organisms Reproduce?

* Asexual: fission, budding, fragmentation, regeneration, spore formation, vegetative propagation.
* Sexual reproduction in plants: flower, pollination, fertilisation, seed formation.
* Human reproduction: male (testes, sperm), female (ovary, egg), fertilisation â†’ zygote â†’ embryo.
* Menstrual cycle.

### 13. Heredity and Evolution

* Mendelâ€™s experiments: monohybrid and dihybrid crosses.
* Law of segregation, law of independent assortment.
* Sex determination (XX, XY).
* Evolution: fossils, homologous and analogous organs.
* Natural selection, speciation.

### 14. Our Environment

* Ecosystem: biotic and abiotic components.
* Food chain & food web.
* Ozone depletion.
* Biological magnification.
* Waste management: biodegradable vs non-biodegradable.

### 15. Sustainable Management of Natural Resources

* 5 Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle.
* Forest and wildlife conservation.
* Water harvesting.
* Fossil fuels management.
